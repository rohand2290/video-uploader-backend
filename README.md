# video-uploader-backend

The backend for a simple video uploader.

## Setup

Clone the repo and create a `.env` file. Write the following:

```
MONGODB_URI = <your_mongodb_uri>
```

Next, in the root of the project directory, create a folder called `uploads`. This will serve as the folder to serve the file uploads for the project.
